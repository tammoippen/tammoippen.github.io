Glad to see you around. Basically, this is a place where I put my stuff: may be some posts about work I do, some photographs, or vacation stories - or whatever I want. This is my place and I can be messy, if I like. Do not expect this page to be always on or functional. I will use it as a playground for experimenting with html5 and css (not so much javascript). See the (upcoming) article about [building this site](/blog).
